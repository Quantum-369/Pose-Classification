# Pose-Classification
Pose classification is the task of identifying the posture or position of a person in an image or video. The goal of this project is to use mediapipe, an open-source framework for building multimodal applied ML pipelines, to develop a pose classification system.

The system will be trained on a dataset of images or videos of people in various poses, such as standing, sitting, or laying down. The model will be designed to take in an image or video frame as input and output the classification of the pose.

To build the model, we will first preprocess the data to extract relevant features for classification. This may involve cropping and resizing the images, as well as extracting features such as the positions of keypoints in the image. We will then use mediapipe to build and train a machine learning model using these features.

Once the model is trained, we will test its performance on a separate evaluation dataset and fine-tune the model as necessary. Finally, we will integrate the model into a mediapipe pipeline for real-time pose classification.

Overall, this project will demonstrate the ability to use mediapipe for developing a reliable and efficient pose classification system.
